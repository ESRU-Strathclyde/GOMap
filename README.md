# GOMap
GOMap is designed to take into account both the technical factors, which encompass renewable energy generation; and the policy factors, which can determine sites' suitability. This can aid decision makers and planners to create, edit, visualise and analyse geospatial information to calculate the most suitable areas for renewable deployment.
